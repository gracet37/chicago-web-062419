USER STORIES

I'd like to

create a new commit message (commits#create, commits#new)
associate a commit with an existing author

see a page with details about a commit (commits#show)
- who wrote it
- what branch is it on
- what's the message itself

modify an existing commit (commits#edit, commits#update)

see a list of all authors (authors#index)

clicking an author shows all their commits (authors#show)

delete an author (authors#destroy)


WORKFLOW

step 1 - understand model domain and relationships
step 2 - get models and migrations
step 3 - define and test associations
step 4 - routes and controllers (remember YAGNI, keep it simple)
